# 1. Implement a SIFT feature extraction for a set of training images ./images/db/train/** (see 2.3 image retrieval)
# use 256x256 keypoints on each image with subwindow of 15x15px

# 2. each descriptor (set of features) need to be flattened in one vector
# That means you need a X_train matrix containing a shape of (num_train_images, num_keypoints*num_entry_per_keypoint)
# num_entry_per_keypoint = histogram orientations as talked about in class
# You also need a y_train vector containing the labels encoded as integers


# 3. We use scikit-learn to train a SVM classifier. Specifically we use a LinearSVC in our case. Have a look at the documentation.
# You will need .fit(X_train, y_train)


# 4. We test on a variety of test images ./images/db/test/ by extracting an image descriptor
# the same way we did for the training (except for a single image now) and use .predict()
# to classify the image

# 5. output the class + corresponding name
